Java Collections framework provides a set of classes and interfaces that are used to manipulate groups of objects. 
It provides numerous classes and interfaces to implement various data structures like lists, sets, maps, queues, etc. 

Here's an overview of some essential components of the Java Collections framework:
**Interfaces:**

List: Ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
Set: Unordered collection that doesn't allow duplicate elements.
Map: Key-value pair collection that doesn't allow duplicate keys.
Queue: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.
Deque: A linear collection allowing insertion and removal at both ends.
**Classes:**

ArrayList: Implements the List interface using a dynamic array. It's resizable and allows fast random access.
LinkedList: Implements the List interface with a doubly-linked list. Suitable for frequent insertion and deletion.
HashSet: Implements the Set interface using a hash table. It does not maintain insertion order.
TreeSet: Implements the Set interface using a sorted tree structure. It stores elements in ascending order.
HashMap: Implements the Map interface using a hash table. Allows one null key and multiple null values.
TreeMap: Implements the Map interface with a red-black tree. Stores keys in sorted order.
Utility Classes:

**Collections:** Provides various utility methods for working with collections such as sorting, searching, synchronizing, etc.
Arrays: Contains methods for manipulating arrays, like sorting and searching.
Iterators:

All collections provide iterators that allow iterating over the elements of the collection.
